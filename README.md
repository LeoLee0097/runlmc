# runlmc

Do you like to apply Bayesian nonparameteric methods to your regressions? Are you frequently tempted by the flexibility that kernel-based learning provides? Do you have trouble getting structured kernel interpolation or various training conditional inducing point approaches to work in a non-stationary multi-output setting?

If so, this package is for you.

**runlmc** is a Python 3 package designed to extend structural efficiencies from _Scalable inference for structured Gaussian process models_ (StaaÃ§i 2012) and _Thoughts on Massively Scalable Gaussian Processes_ (Wilson et al 2015) to the non-stationary setting of linearly coregionalized multiple-output regressions. For the single output setting, MATLAB implementations are available [here](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/).

In other words, this provides a matrix-free implementation of multi-output GPs for certain covariances. As far as I know, this is also the only matrix-free implementation for single-output GPs in python.

## Usage Notes

* Currently, I'm only supporting 1 input dimension.
* Docs avaliable [on the product page](https://vlad17.github.io/runlmc)

## A note on GPy

[GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy) is a way more general GP library that was a strong influence in the development of this one. I've tried to stay as faithful as possible to its structure.

I've re-used a lot of the GPy code. The main issue with simply adding my methods to GPy is that the API used to interact between GPy's `kern`, `likelihood`, and `inference` packages centers around the `dL_dK` object, a matrix derivative of the likelihood with respect to covariance. The materialization of this matrix is the very thing my algorithm tries to avoid for performance.

If there is some quantifiable success with this approach then integration with GPy would be a reasonable next-step.

## Examples and Benchmarks

### Snippet

Note: currently derivatives are not implemented, nor is the package optimized for speed yet.

Full example 

    n_per_output = [65, 100]
    xss = list(map(np.random.rand, n_per_output))
    yss = [f(2 * np.pi * xs) + np.random.randn(len(xs)) * 0.05
           for f, xs in zip([np.sin, np.cos], xss)]
    ks = [RBF(name='rbf{}'.format(i)) for i in range(nout)]
    lmc = LMC(xss, yss, kernels=ks)
    # ... plotting code

    lmc.optimize(optimizer=AdaDelta()) # batteries included!
    # ... more plotting code

### Running the Examples and Benchmarks

Make sure that the directory root is in the `PYTHONPATH` when running the benchmarks. E.g., from the directory root:

    PYTHONPATH=. python benchmark/inversion.py
    
Similarly, for examples:

    cd examples; PYTHONPATH=.. jupyter notebook example.ipynb
        
## Dev Stuff

Required packages for running (Python 3 versions): `numpy scipy climin gpy paramz contexttimer pandas`. For dev `nose sphinx`.

All below invocations should be done from the repo root.
 
| Command           | Purpose  |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| `./style.sh`      | Check style with pylint, ignoring TODOs and locally-disabled warnings. |
| `./docbuild.sh`   | Regenerate docs (index will be in `doc/_generated/_build/runlmc.html`) |
| `./docpush.sh`   | Publish current docs (requries write access to repo) |
| `nosetests -l DEBUG`       | Run unit tests |

### Roadmap

0. large FX test - need to implement COGP, runlmc on small 3K + large FX datasets; may have to set up python on fat server
0. Write up ICML paper.
0. linalg in-place optimization; square matrices optimization
0. TODO(general-solve) Preconditioner?
    * Does chan Preconditioner carry over to SKI approximation?
    * Do other inner circulant preconditioners (e.g., whittle) help inversion?
    * Cache LCG solutions over iterations? Cutajar approach?
0. Minor perf improvements: what helps?
    * MKL
    * CPython
    * In-place multiplication where possible; square matrix optimizations
    * TODO(sparse-derivatives)
    * Short-circuit minres if no progress on convergence?
0. travis-ci, read the docs automatic doc builds
0. TODO(fix) - better lmc testing. Also investigate: when is iteration NOT converging (critical log) - what's the condition number in that case.
0. multidimensional inputs and ARD.
0. TODO(fast-prediction) fast predictions
0. low-rank dense multiplications give SumKernel speedups? TODO(sum-fast)
0. TODO(prior). Compare to [spike and slab](http://www.aueb.gr/users/mtitsias/publications.html), also try MedGP (e.g., three-parameter beta) - add tests for priored versions of classes, some tests in parameterization/ (priors should be value-cached, try to use an external package)

### Considerations 

* Real datasets: [link1](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~davidc/publications_MTGP.php) 
* MINRES or LCG?
* Why are sparse eigensolvers poor? Can we use them as an accurate general-purpose solution if all else fails?
* Consider other approximate inverse algorithms: see Thm 2.4 of [Agarwal, Allen-Zhu, Bullins, Hazan, Ma 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01146)
0. Logdet Approximations? (1) [Chebyshev-Hutchinson](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06394) [Code](https://sites.google.com/site/mijirim/logdet) (2) [Integral Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02661).

### Low-priority Tasks

0. BSD 3-clause
0. TODO(cleanup) - apprx to approx everywhere
0. Allow extrapolation in util.interpolation.py
0. TODO(test) - document everything that's missing documentation along the way.
0. test `LMC._raw_predict` unit testing, by using K_SKI() and anlogous math
0. np.linalg.eigvalsh -> scipy.linalg.eigvalsh (numpy.linalg -> scipy.linalg as la, scipy.sparse.linalg as sla)
0. rename `rand_psd` -> `rand_pd`
0. Continuous integration for unit tests
0. mean functions
0. product kernels (multiple factors) 
0. active dimension optimization

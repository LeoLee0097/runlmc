# runlmc

Do you like to apply Bayesian nonparameteric methods to your regressions? Are you frequently tempted by the flexibility that kernel-based learning provides? Do you have trouble getting structured kernel interpolation or various training conditional inducing point approaches to work in a non-stationary multi-output setting?

If so, this package is for you.

**runlmc** is a Python 3 package designed to extend structural efficiencies from _Scalable inference for structured Gaussian process models_ (StaaÃ§i 2012) and _Thoughts on Massively Scalable Gaussian Processes_ (Wilson et al 2015) to the non-stationary setting of linearly coregionalized multiple-output regressions. For the single output setting, MATLAB implementations are available [here](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/).

In other words, this provides a matrix-free implementation of multi-output GPs for certain covariances. As far as I know, this is also the only matrix-free implementation for single-output GPs in python.

## Usage Notes

* Currently, I'm only supporting 1 input dimension.
* Docs avaliable [on the product page](https://vlad17.github.io/runlmc)

## A note on GPy

[GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy) is a way more general GP library that was a strong influence in the development of this one. I've tried to stay as faithful as possible to its structure.

I've re-used a lot of the GPy code. The main issue with simply adding my methods to GPy is that the API used to interact between GPy's `kern`, `likelihood`, and `inference` packages centers around the `dL_dK` object, a matrix derivative of the likelihood with respect to covariance. The materialization of this matrix is the very thing my algorithm tries to avoid for performance.

If there is some quantifiable success with this approach then integration with GPy would be a reasonable next-step.

## Examples and Benchmarks

### Snippet

    n_per_output = [65, 100]
    xss = list(map(np.random.rand, n_per_output))
    yss = [f(2 * np.pi * xs) + np.random.randn(len(xs)) * 0.05
           for f, xs in zip([np.sin, np.cos], xss)]
    ks = [RBF(name='rbf{}'.format(i)) for i in range(nout)]
    lmc = LMC(xss, yss, kernels=ks)
    # ... plotting code
        
![unopt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad17/runlmc/master/examples/unopt.png)

    lmc.optimize()
    # ... more plotting code

For runnable code, check `examples/`.
        
### Running the Examples and Benchmarks

Make sure that the directory root is in the `PYTHONPATH` when running the benchmarks. E.g., from the directory root:

    PYTHONPATH=.. jupyter notebook examples/example.ipynb
    cd benchmarks/fx2007 && ./run.sh # will take a while!
    
## Dev Stuff

Required packages for running (Python 3 versions): `numpy scipy climin GPy paramz contexttimer pandas`. For dev `nose sphinx` as well.

All below invocations should be done from the repo root.
 
| Command           | Purpose  |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| `./style.sh`      | Check style with pylint, ignoring TODOs and locally-disabled warnings. |
| `./docbuild.sh`   | Regenerate docs (index will be in `doc/_generated/_build/runlmc.html`) |
| `./docpush.sh`   | Publish current docs (requries write access to repo) |
| `nosetests -l DEBUG`       | Run unit tests |

### Roadmap

0. Benchmark cleanup: activating logs should be programatic.
0. Benchmark cleanup: better docs for running stuff
0. Benchmark cleanup: dedup code / clean up `benchmarks/benchlib/standard_tester.py`
0. Benchmark cleanup: OMP_NUM_THREADS should be standardized somehow.
0. Benchmark speedup: slurm-broadcasted prediction?
0. Rm extrapool - do we even need pool caching? just make sure `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` or some reasonable amount if parallelism is reduced). - should this env variable be checked, warning (through logging or python) be printed?
0. Preconditioning
    * Cache Krylov solutions over iterations?
    * Cutajar 2016 iterative inversion approach?
0. Minor perf improvements: what helps?
    * CPython; numba.
    * In-place multiplication where possible
    * square matrix optimizations
    * TODO(sparse-derivatives)
0. travis-ci, auto doc builds, auto benchmarks
0. TODO(sum-fast) low-rank dense multiplications give SumKernel speedups?
0. multidimensional inputs and ARD.
0. TODO(prior). Compare to [spike and slab](http://www.aueb.gr/users/mtitsias/publications.html), also try MedGP (e.g., three-parameter beta) - add tests for priored versions of classes, some tests in parameterization/ (priors should be value-cached, try to use an external package)

### Considerations 

* Real datasets: [link1](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~davidc/publications_MTGP.php) 
* Consider other approximate inverse algorithms: see Thm 2.4 of [Agarwal, Allen-Zhu, Bullins, Hazan, Ma 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01146)
0. Logdet Approximations? (1) [Chebyshev-Hutchinson](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06394) [Code](https://sites.google.com/site/mijirim/logdet) (2) [Integral Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02661).

### Low-priority Tasks

0. TODO(cleanup) - apprx to approx everywhere, kerns to kernels
0. Allow extrapolation in util.interpolation.py
0. TODO(test) - document everything that's missing documentation along the way.
0. test `LMC._raw_predict` unit testing, by using K_SKI() and anlogous math
0. np.linalg.eigvalsh -> scipy.linalg.eigvalsh (numpy.linalg -> scipy.linalg as la, scipy.sparse.linalg as sla)
0. rename `rand_psd` -> `rand_pd`
0. Continuous integration for unit tests
0. mean functions
0. product kernels (multiple factors) 
0. active dimension optimization
